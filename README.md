# Capstone_MuscleHub_AB_Test_Codeacademy
A project in the CodeAcademy Data Analytics course that serves as a first data analysis portfolio piece.

All relevant .csv data, etc, is found in the Data Files folder. A presentation has been created as well, saved in multiple formats for viewing both online and offline, saved in the Presentation files. The main body of analysis work is done on jupyter notebook, with the included .ipynb files here. A .pdf rendition of this is also included in the event that viewing in jupyter notebook is not possible or practical for viewing at a given time.
